This was a lot of fun, I kinda wish I could have worked on it more. The biggest challenges I faced were determining what to use as a back end (I strongly considered socket.io and mongoDB for persistance), getting back into the swing of things with React (I have been using Vue for the past 9 months or so), and just keeping myself from going totally Ape adding features.

Ultimately I went with Firebase for a back end since their realtime database could handle not only persistance but also syncing across instances. This allowed me to set up some basic config and then be off to the races on the front end.

Since I have been using Vue for the past 9 months there was a bit of adjustment with getting back into the syntax of React. Once I started though it came back pretty quickly. I decided to build the front end portion of this in React since your front end stack is React. I set up some basic tests that are really more stubs and would need to be fleshed out in a production app.
